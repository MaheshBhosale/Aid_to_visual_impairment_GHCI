This repository contains code for deeplearning based aid for visually impaired people.
It mainly uses the mobile imagery data to provide the assisstnace for the visually impaired people. 
We are proposing to give two types of assistance in knowledge of surrounding environmental and navigational assistance in the journey from one to another point, might that be indoor or outdoor.
README would be updated as we build different modules of the system gradually.
